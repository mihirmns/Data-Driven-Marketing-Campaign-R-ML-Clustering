# Mihir

The data contain information on
passengers who belong to an airline's frequent flyer program. The data include information on
customers' mileage history and the different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year.
The primary objective is to cluster customers into different segments, analyze each group's
characteristics, and design targeted marketing campaigns (i.e., different types of mileage offers).
